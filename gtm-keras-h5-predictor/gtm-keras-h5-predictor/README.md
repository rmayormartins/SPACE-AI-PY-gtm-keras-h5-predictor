## Description 
In Google Teachable Machine, after training, under 'Export Model', go to 'Tensorflow', click on 'Keras' and then 'Download my model' (wait a moment). The zip will contain the Keras .h5 model. This application allows users to upload these models and test them with their own images.

## How to Use
1. Train a model in Google Teachable Machine.
2. Export and download the model as a Keras .h5 file (in Tensorflow, in middle, click on Keras, Download my model).
3. Upload the model (.zip or .h5) and your test images to the application.
4. View the predictions made by the model.
